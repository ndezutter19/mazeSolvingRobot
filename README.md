Overview

This repository features the MATLAB code and documentation for a sophisticated robot created using the LEGO Mindstorms EV3 kit. This robot is not only designed to autonomously navigate and solve mazes but also to pick up and transport objects and execute actions based on color detection.
Features

    Autonomous Maze Navigation: Employs sensors to detect walls and navigate through mazes.
    Object Transport: Capable of picking up and transporting a lightweight cardboard figure using a custom attachment.
    Color Sensing: Uses a color sensor to perform specific actions when detecting particular colors, enhancing its interaction with the environment.
    Path Optimization: Calculates the most efficient path within the maze, improving performance over time.
    MATLAB Integration: Developed in MATLAB with a special plugin for control and data collection from the EV3 robot.
